## API & Backend Integration

- **Authentication**: Uses JWT tokens stored securely. Supports Google and Apple OAuth.
- **Book Data**: Fetches book info from Google Books API and your own backend (set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in your environment).
- **Friends**: All friend operations (add, remove, requests) are handled via backend API endpoints.
- **Password Reset**: Email-based reset via backend API.

> **Note:** You must configure the `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` and OAuth client IDs in your environment for full functionality.

## Customization & Theming
